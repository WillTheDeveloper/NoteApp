# NoteApp
Just a note application that I made in C# on Visual Studio using Windows forms.

I did it while I was bored to practice some of my C# skills with reading and writing files.

Inspired by some ideas I found on the internet.

Fork it if you want, I do like making things more effecient where possible.
